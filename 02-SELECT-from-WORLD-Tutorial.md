1. [Read the notes about this table.](https://www.sqlzoo.net/wiki/Read_the_notes_about_this_table.) Observe the result of running this SQL command to show the name, continent and population of all countries.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, continent, population FROM world
   ```

2. [How to use WHERE to filter records.](https://www.sqlzoo.net/wiki/WHERE_filters) Show the name for the countries that have a population of at least 200 million. 200 million is 200000000, there are eight zeros.

   ```sql
   SELECT name FROM world
   WHERE population >= 200000000
   ```

3. Give the `name` and the **per capita GDP** for those countries with a `population` of at least 200 million.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, GDP/population FROM world
   WHERE population >= 200000000
   ```

4. Show the `name` and `population` in millions for the countries of the `continent` 'South America'. Divide the population by 1000000 to get population in millions.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, population/1000000 FROM world
   WHERE continent = 'South America'
   ```

5. Show the `name` and `population` for France, Germany, Italy

   ```sql
   SELECT name, population FROM world
   WHERE name IN ('France', 'Germany', 'Italy')
   ```

6. Show the countries which have a `name` that includes the word 'United'

   ```sql
   SELECT name FROM world
   WHERE name LIKE '%United%'
   ```

7. Two ways to be big: A country is **big** if it has an area of more than 3 million sq km or it has a population of more than 250 million.

   Show the countries that are big by area or big by population. Show name, population and area.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, population, area FROM world
   WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 250000000
   ```

8. Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area (more than 3 million) or big by population (more than 250 million) but not both. Show name, population and area.

   - Australia has a big area but a small population, it should be **included**.
   - Indonesia has a big population but a small area, it should be **included**.
   - China has a big population **and** big area, it should be **excluded**.
   - United Kingdom has a small population and a small area, it should be **excluded**.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, population, area FROM world
   WHERE area >= 3000000 XOR population >= 250000000
   ```

9. Show the `name` and `population` in millions and the GDP in billions for the countries of the `continent` 'South America'. Use the [ROUND](https://www.sqlzoo.net/wiki/ROUND) function to show the values to two decimal places.

   For Americas show population in millions and GDP in billions both to 2 decimal places.

   ```sql
   SELECT 
   name, ROUND(population/1000000.0, 2),ROUND(GDP/1000000000.0, 2) 
   FROM world
   WHERE continent = 'South America'
   ```

10. Show the `name` and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of at least one trillion (1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). Round this value to the nearest 1000.

    Show per-capita GDP for the trillion dollar countries to the nearest $1000.

    ```sql
    SELECT name, round(gdp/population,-3) FROM world
    WHERE gdp >= 1000000000000
    ```

11. Greece has capital Athens.

    Each of the strings 'Greece', and 'Athens' has 6 characters.

    Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same number of characters.

    - You can use the [LENGTH](https://www.sqlzoo.net/wiki/LENGTH) function to find the number of characters in a string

    ```sql
    SELECT name, capital
    FROM world
    WHERE LENGTH(name)=LENGTH(capital)
    ```

12. The capital of Sweden is Stockholm. Both words start with the letter 'S'.

    Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word.

    - You can use the function [LEFT](https://www.sqlzoo.net/wiki/LEFT) to isolate the first character.
    - You can use `<>` as the **NOT EQUALS** operator.

    ```sql
    SELECT name, capital
    FROM world
    WHERE LEFT(name, 1) = LEFT(capital, 1) AND name <> capital
    ```

13. **Equatorial Guinea** and **Dominican Republic** have all of the vowels (a e i o u) in the name. They don't count because they have more than one word in the name.

    Find the country that has all the vowels and no spaces in its name.

    - You can use the phrase `name NOT LIKE '%a%'` to exclude characters from your results.
    - The query shown misses countries like Bahamas and Belarus because they contain at least one 'a'

    ```sql
    SELECT name FROM world
    WHERE 
    name LIKE '%a%' AND length(name) - length(replace(name, 'a', '')) = 1 AND 
    name LIKE '%e%' AND length(name) - length(replace(name, 'e', '')) = 1 AND 
    name LIKE '%i%' AND length(name) - length(replace(name, 'i', '')) = 1 AND 
    name LIKE '%o%' AND length(name) - length(replace(name, 'o', '')) = 1 AND 
    name LIKE '%u%' AND length(name) - length(replace(name, 'u', '')) = 1 AND 
    name NOT LIKE '% %'
    
    ```
